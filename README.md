# Pig Game - Short JS game

### How to play the game

![New game starting screen] (/readmeImages/StartingScreen.png)

This is a two player. You press the roll button to roll a dice. Every dice roll bigger than one is added to your temporary score. After a roll, you can choose to hold and add your temporary score to your permanent score, or you can roll again.

If you roll a one, the player has to switch and now the other player has to roll the dice.

First to get 100 score wins the game!

This is a project that was made during my learning process of JS, following Jonas Schmedtmann's (https://codingheroes.io/) course for javaScript. Credits to him for this idea and the provided structure.
